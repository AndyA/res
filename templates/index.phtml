  				Welcome to the Research and Education Space (RES) â€“ an initiative to improve access to public archives for use in education.
  			</h1>
  			<p>
  				Since 2012, the RES project has been working with teachers, students and academics, along with curators of world class digital collections and product developers to improve the resources and tools available in all levels of education.  RES is a partnership between <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a>, the <a href="http://bufvc.ac.uk/">British Universities Film &amp; Video Council (BUFVC)</a> and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a>. 
  			</p>
        <p>
          The BBC has built an open platform which indexes and organises the catalogues of many of our libraries, museums, broadcasters and galleries and the assets they describe, including documents, images, TV and radio programmes. Developers can then incorporate or build products on the RES platform to provide access to these collections via educational tools.

          The RES platform indexes collections [add hyperlink to Collections] from organisations, such as The British Museum, British Library, The National Archives, Europeana, Wellcome Trust, the BBC and Tate galleries, to make their content more discoverable, accessible and usable to those in UK education and research. It also enables developers to create digital educational products that will inspire learners, teachers and researchers by using applications powered by the RES platform.
