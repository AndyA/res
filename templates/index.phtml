          The BBC has built an open platform which indexes and organises the catalogues of many of our libraries, museums, broadcasters and galleries and the assets they describe, including documents, images, TV and radio programmes. Developers can then incorporate or build products on the RES platform to provide access to these collections via educational tools.
